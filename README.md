# 9️⃣ Ninetail
Alternative approach for Nine Chronicles Launcher (...and other utils hopefully)

Project just... for fun I guess? it's totally unofficial.

I don't know. I'm bit tired of messing with webpack and electron. just want to try something different.

# Goal
## Essential Features
- __Launch The Game__ ~DUH~
- __Update Game & Launcher__
- __Login__

## Key Differences
- RESPONSIVE UI
- Minimal Package Configuration.

## Just Features
- Keystore / Private Key Management
- Remote Node Status Viewer / Selector
- NCG Transactions (Swap, Transfer)
- Monster Collection, Staking, Claim Stake Reward
- Other... data querying? Chain Status? IDK
